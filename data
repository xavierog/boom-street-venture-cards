Card Type: Moneymaking
Rating: 7/10
Info/Comments: This will let you steal coins from the player in first. The die used has the same maximum as the board you are on (This is true for ALL die-based venture cards that don't state their effects from specific numbers). If you are in first ALONE, it does nothing. If you are tied for first, you can steal from everyone tied with you. This card is quite effective right at first when everyone's net worths are the same so you can steal from everyone.
