# Boom Street venture cards table generator

Do you play [Boom Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itadaki_Street), also known as Fortune Street, Itadaki Street or Course Ã€ La Fortune ?

If so, you likely noticed venture cards play an important role in the game.
This repository provides a single, simple Python script that turns a text-based description of an 8x8 venture card board into an HTML page that describes each available card.

## How to?

### Step 0: install Python

This step is typically for Windows users as Linux/MacOS/BSD users typically
benefit from Python out of the box.

1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Learn [how to run a Python script](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows)

### Step 1: describe a venture card board

Using your favorite [plain text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor),
describe any venture card board by writing 8 lines of 8 space-separated numbers:

```
 42 65 52  46 95 75 27  2
 85  9 77  18 99 26 36 57
100 37 40  43  5 71 53 96
 62 58 38 106 72 73 60 16
  4 76 83  86 81 10  3 23
 80 78 56  13 39  1 63 22
 94 74 55  67 33 82 91 87
 20 31 29  14 45 48 50 93
Anything after line #8 is ignored.
Feel free to store comments or other data here.
```

In this example, we assume the board above is saved as "example.txt".

### Step 2: generate the HTML page

```shell
./generate.py < example.txt > example.html
```

### Step 3: open the HTML page

Using your favorite browser (e.g. Firefox or Chrome), open the resulting file (here, `example.html`).
